        <h3>My Story </h3>

        <p>I was born in Berkeley, and moved to the Central Valley as a kid. While growing up I would often visit my grandparents with backgrounds in letterpress printing and architectural design. They would make sure to include an art project or museum trip into any visit, and I think this is where I grew to appreciate and love design.

In high school I found myself being drawn to both design and programming, taking art classes alongside coding classes. This extended to my college career where I went partially in on a Computer Science program before switching my major to Design. 

In terms of work, I started with volunteering for clean-ups and Habitat for Humanity. I got my first job in design helping a freelance web designer make websites for local businesses. Later I worked for a print shop running industrial printers and automating Adobe workflows. My most recent assignment was with a City wastewater engineering team, maintaining software and creating technical specifications for everything developed.
